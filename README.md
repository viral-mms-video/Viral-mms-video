A MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) video refers to a short video clip that spreads rapidly across mobile phones and other platforms through MMS. These videos often gain widespread attention due to their humorous, shocking, or emotional content. Since MMS allows the transfer of media such as videos, images, and audio between mobile phones, viral MMS videos typically rely on peer-to-peer sharing, where users forward the video to others within their social circles.

The phenomenon of viral MMS videos started becoming prominent in the early 2000s, as mobile phones with camera and video recording capabilities became more common. With the advent of social media and internet sharing platforms, these videos could quickly spread beyond just mobile phones, gaining millions of views in a short amount of time. Common examples of viral MMS videos include funny pranks, unexpected accidents, viral dances, emotional moments, or outrageous public events.

While the viral nature of these videos is often linked to their entertainment value, they can also spark debates about privacy, consent, and the ethics of sharing videos without the knowledge or permission of the people involved. In some cases, videos that go viral can lead to unintended consequences for the individuals featured in them, from online harassment to legal issues. 

The shift to internet-based video-sharing platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram has somewhat diminished the prevalence of traditional MMS viral videos, but the concept of something quickly becoming "viral" remains integral to online media culture today.
